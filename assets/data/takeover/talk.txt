:bf:Who the fuck even are you? 
:bf:What is even going on here? 
:cass-scared: ...
:bf:You're not making any sense, lady. 
:bf:Where the FUCK is my Girlfriend? 
:cass-scared: ...
:cass-angry: I don't want her here...
:bf:Why? 
:cass-scared: ...
:cass-angry: I can't stand her. 
:cass-scared: She didn't care for me. 
:cass-scared: Our parents only wanted her to be successful. 
:cass-angry: They shoved me aside...
:bf:...
:bf:Bro quit that vague bullshit and get to the goddamn point. 
:cass-angry: Okay damn... 
:cass-angry: ...
:cass-angry: Don't be such a dick. 
:bf: Not my fault you're being edgy
:cass-angry: Damn. 
:bf: Dawg,
:bf: Goth girls are hot an all,
:bf: But this is starting to get into territory I don't want to get involved in.
:bf: Your dad already tried to rip my balls off,
:bf: Your mom literally almost kicked me into traffic,
:bf: I already delt with a bomb, a toaster, a skeleton horse man, some fucks that look like ice cream cones, and some other weirdos. 
:bf: Can't we just let this chill out. 
:cass-angry: How do you think I feel being used to cause chaos for uncontrollable reasons? 
:bf: The FUCK are you on about? 
:cass-scared: .
:bf:...
:bf: Ok ok maybe I've been aggressive, 
:bf: Whatever you went through I don't want to get too deep involved. 
:bf: Especially since I don't want to deal with more issues in this family. 
:bf: I get it you probably got some family beef,
:bf: But I just want to chill with my girl. 
:bf: I know how it feels being distant from a sibling and being forced to keep higher expectations in the family. 
:bf: So you're not alone on that part. 
:cass-scared: Really? 
:bf: Yeah
:bf: But anyways, can you just take me out of,,, whatever this place is?
:spider: Can I,
:spider: Have another song with you... 
:spider: Someone told me that I should make music more often, 
:spider: Then I'll take you out ok? 
:bf: ...
:bf: A-Alright then...
